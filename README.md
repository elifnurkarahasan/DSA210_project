# DSA210 PROJECT REPORT

# Motivation

-Project Idea & Motivation:

Throughout my years of playing games, I always had difficulties in finding games that suit my liking. Although I am not someone who plays games all the time, I have played quite a lot of games. However, due to the rising game prices in the Steam application, it has become much more important to buy games that are actually worth the money you are paying for them. I have thought on this and decided that the way to decide if a game is worth buying is to understand what I like and how many hours I play a game for (in other words, how long the game keeps me entertained). Therefore my goal is to analyze my historical gaming data to predict future preferences, including identifying favorite genres, estimating genres of future game purchases along with their (predicted) prices, analyzing purchase trends, understanding patterns, and evaluating preferences.


# Data Source

-Dataset Collection:

I got this data by utilizing Steam's "Steam DB" feature. Steam DB is one of Steam's qualities which offers its users to see their gaming data in a tabular manner. Various gaming data of users are listed in this page, and users can easily access the data they are trying to find about their account.

I collected the data by copying the rows of data in my Steam DB one by one and pasting them into an excel file I created. I had modified the excel file so that it contains the associated column names in the Steam DB. I transfered each row of data into the excel file and reached a total of 90 rows of data. To use this data for my project's visualization and prediction modeling stage, I included a section at the start of my code that enabled uploading documents.

-Dataset Description:

The dataset focuses on my personal Steam profile to then help me visualize and analyze gaming preferences and behavior patterns. The attributes that will be presented in the dataset include game title, genre, playtime (hours), game rating, price, and price per hour.


# Project Plan

1) Data Collection: Gather and preprocess data from my Steam profile. Prepare the dataset, its attributes and their values accordingly.

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and summarize patterns in the dataset.

3) Model Development: Build predictive models for analyzing stage, such as for finding out game preferences and future purchase estimations.

4) Insight Generation: Derive actionable insights from the analysis.

5) Documentation and Reporting: Present findings with visualizations and a detailed report.

6) Deliverables: Structured dataset, analysis report, predictive model, GitHub repository with code, visualizations.
