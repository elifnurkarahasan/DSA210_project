Dataset Description
The dataset focuses on analyzing my personal Steam profile to uncover gaming preferences and behavior patterns. The attributes that will be presented in the dataset include game title, genre, playtime (hours), purchase date, last played date, game rating, price, multiplayer, and release year.

Project Idea
The goal is to analyze my historical gaming data to predict future preferences, including identifying favorite genres, estimating playtime for new games, analyzing purchase trends, understanding session patterns, and evaluating multiplayer preferences.

Project Plan
Data Collection: Gather and preprocess data from my Steam profile.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and summarize patterns in the dataset.
Model Development: Build predictive models for game preferences and playtime estimation.
Insight Generation: Derive actionable insights from the analysis.
Documentation and Reporting: Present findings with visualizations and a detailed report.
Deliverables:
Structured dataset, analysis report, predictive model, GitHub repository with code, visualizations.
